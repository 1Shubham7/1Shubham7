### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Shubham from India. I am First year undergrad (Computer Science Engineering) from a tier-3 college, I love open-source. I am a web developer, Andriod developer, open-source enthusiast, and right now I am learning DevOps. When not coding, I will find me reading books, listening podcasts around history, geopolitics, tech and entrepreneurship.
