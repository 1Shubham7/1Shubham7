# Hi there 👋
This is Shubham, 

I am a Computer Science undergrad with a passion for software.

I am a CKA and currently working as a SRE at Obmondo. I am a LFX  graduated mentee (Term 2, 2024), before that I used to work as a technical writing intern at GeeksforGeeks, and before that I worked as a web dev intern at Hooman Digital. I am Linux Foundation Scholar, Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador and KubeCon'24 Speaker.

My primary tech stack is Golang + Kubernetes. I actively contribute to the CNCF ecosystem, I am a contributor and org member at CNCF KubeEdge, and previously a official contributor at CNCF Kyverno.
